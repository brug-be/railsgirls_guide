## New Rails Girls guide

The Rails Girls Brussels team is working on a new Rails Girls guide, which does not start with a dive into Rails, but rather starts with an HTML page. Then we are slowly adding other concepts, making the bridge to why we want to automate things and have Rails in place.

## Local setup

To setup the project on your machine locally:

* clone the project to your machine: `git clone git@github.com:brug-be/railsgirls_guide.git`
* run `bundle install` to install dependencies
* run `jekyll serve` to start the local server

## Hosted instance

A current version of this guide is hosted on [github pages](http://brug-be.github.io/railsgirls_guide/).
